# FitLit For Life

#### The Makings of a Fitness and Quality of Life Tracking App;

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 4/6/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Technologies Used

* `javaScript`
* `HTML`
* `CSS`
* `Eslint`

## Goals and Objectives

* Impliment ES6 classes
* Clean class to class interaction
* Utilize object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a dashboard that displays information easily for the user on the DOM
* Utilize testing suite to verify security of class build out using `TDD`
* Manipulate and clean up the organization of the data files before they are displayed on the `DOM`

## Overview

* This project was a little bit of a trojan horse.  We thought we were getting to build an app and its purpose was to teach data manipulation.  Robust testing should allow for errorless class to class interaction and subsequently easier code to write when finally manipulating the `DOM`.

## Setup

* Clone this repo to your local computer
* To review code open your text editor
* Read the whole README.md
* To view the data presentation on the `DOM` run the command `open src/index.html`

## Project Link

## Contributors

* [Pat Findley](https://github.com/Patfindley)
* [Angela Battillo](https://github.com/battan40)

## Functionality Goals

* With `mocha` and `chai`tooling in place set up a robust test suite to verify class properties and methods are sound and reinforce `TDD`
* `javaScript` syntax is *DRY*, *MODULAR*, and as often as possible holds to the *SRP*
* Testing suite uses its own testing data and has happy and sad path testing
* Each completed iteration should populate on the `DOM` with no bugs, crashes or missing functionality
